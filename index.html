      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>Greetings!
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Joseph Halcombe and I am a Computer Science Undergraduate at Michigan Technological University. I also graduated with my Associates in Application Development from Lake Michigan College in 2021. I come from a town called Stevensville, in southwest Michigan.  My goal for this site is to give you the chance to get to know me a bit better!

Thank you for your time,
<br>
-Joe </p>
